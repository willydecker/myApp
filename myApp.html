  <p>Meteor is an end to end Javascript powerhouse.</p>
  <ul type="square">
  <p>The power to create an entire program ready to run in moments and with
    very little amount of commands</p>
  <p>The use of the same code in both the server and client</p>
  <p>You app is automatically responsive / no need for code to make it so</p>
  <p>Very easy to use / write code</p>
  <p>Hundreds of built in libraries to ease the annoyance of coding for
    different platforms</p>
  <p>Made for the programmer happiness</p>
</ul>

<template name="secPar">
  <p>One of the best features of Meteor is the use of one simple command to
    create entire ready to use programs.</p>
  <p>With a line as simple as meteor create "what type of project you want" it
    builds what you want in moments.</p>
  <p>For a basic demonstration I will show you a basic build of a SPA that
    counts clicks from the user.</p>
    <h3><center>Using 3 lines of code I will create and run the
      whole program.</center></h3>
    <h4><center>meteor create helloWorld</center></h4>
    <h4><center>cd helloWorld</center></h4>
    <h4><center>meteor</center></h4>

<template name="thirPar">
  <p>Meteor has a feature that has ALL event code inside of one convenient and
    premade area.</p>
  <p>You have one spot that handles all of the Client and Server events and
    causes the whole program to react.</p>
</template>

<Template name="fouPar">
  <p>Now I will show you the program that I created with the help of the book
    “Meteor in Action” by MEAP.</p>
  <p>The program is a generic app that keeps track of what you have in your
    fridge and what you need to get from the store.</p>
  <p>I will first show the program and then the code that got it running.
    Note the shortness of the code, how simple the functions are, and how the
    .js file has both client and server.</p>

  <p>In these modern times, when a program pops up and flips the game around
    you should pay attention at the very least. Times change quickly and with a
    community that just adds and adds to making Meteor run and more features
    being released on a weekly basis, it is not hard to see Meteor being used
    on a daily basis by major websites. This makes it important for jobs and
    your career.</p>
